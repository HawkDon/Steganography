We have set a project up for the exercise and are about to search up on the problem and create solution

We have decided to use Olivers computer so everyone can contribute with ideas and help each other out as much as possible.

Our issue is to find a hidden message in a picture, and we know that it is a ASCII message we have to find and print out.

I am trying to convert the images pixels to bytes and operate on those. I used the following resource for inspiration
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3801275/how-to-convert-image-to-byte-array

I made a huge mistake and tried to convert the bytes into string binaries and later convert them back as bytes.
this meant that the String we operated on such as "10011000" got converted over and gave wrong bytes of bits... woops

I decided to try and decode the message online with a decoder... Didn't seem to provide any message... this seems odd:

Could be the resource though.
Tried another one but it doesn't seem to provide me any help:

We decided to call if for a day. We created a list of bytes but some of them doesn't seem to be valid in the conversion. We are not entirely
sure where to go from here. We might give it a shot later in the weekend.
